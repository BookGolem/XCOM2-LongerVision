Thanks for looking at this mod!

Changes:
Increases sight range by five times (from 17 to 85 squares).
Adapts weapon range tables to account for new weapon ranges - possibly too long?
Increases number of active enemies, because you're definately going to be seeing more than six at a time.

Currently only works for vanilla enemies.
