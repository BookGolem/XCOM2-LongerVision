Thanks for looking at this mod!

Changes:
Increases sight range by five times (from 17 to 85 squares).
Adapts weapon range tables to account for new weapon ranges - possibly too long for sniper/vektor rifles.
Increases number of active enemies, because you're definately going to be seeing more than six at a time.

Currently not working for modded enemies/allies - Mod may need to load last to apply effects?

Works for SMGs.

Anything using a custom range table (ally or enemy) will end up using its longest range option if beyond that range (eg, the basic Shotgun would cap at -30 using the standard table, even firing at 70+ squared away).
In particular, this will affect Hunter Rifles from the Pathfinders mod - the range tables for these drop off dramatically, which I have taken to be a design choice of the modmaker. As such, 
I have not extended these tables, and so while the penalties stack up they will cap out below -100. (-70 for tier 1, down to -50 for tier 3 at max range);
